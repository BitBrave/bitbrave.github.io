I received the B.Eng. from Nankai University, China, in 2018, and the Ph.D. degree from the Institute of Information Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences, in 2023. My research interests include network security and artificial intelligence, in particular, intrusion detection and defense about APT (Advanced Persistent Threat).
